# Hangman

Hangman is a 2-player game that requires one player to select a word of their choice and provide the number of letters that make up that word to the other player, their objective being to correctly guess those letters and/or the entire word correctly. In the online version of this game, the computer will serve as the player providing a random word for the opponent to guess. A keyboard will be displayed for the opponent to click and select letters from, along with a space for inputting an entire word. When the computer selects a word at random, blank lines for each letter of that word will be provided and populated upon each correct guess by the opponent. The opponent will be given 8 guesses in each round, which includes one full word guess, and they will have up to 9 words to guess total. Guessing all 9 words correctly wins the game, but if a player cannot guess a word correctly they must start over.
